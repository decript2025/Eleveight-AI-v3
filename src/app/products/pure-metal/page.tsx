            Pure Metal is a GPU-enabled virtual machine rental service for AI workloads where
            near bare-metal performance and a consistent, predictable configuration matter,
            without the operational overhead of complex provisioning. The virtual machines are
            delivered ready for training and inference so teams can start compute jobs quickly
            and scale projects without building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure
            themselves.
          </p>

          <p className="text-background/55 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            In Pure Metal, the GPU is assigned to the virtual machine via PCI Express
            passthrough, giving the guest OS native access to the accelerator. For distributed
            workloads, GPU resources are dynamically interconnected through a high-speed
            InfiniBand fabric, providing a foundation for intensive data exchange between nodes
            in GPU-centric scenarios. Each configuration includes 20 CPU cores per GPU, helping
            balance CPU and GPU utilization in typical AI pipelines and supporting data
            preparation and auxiliary compute alongside model execution.
          </p>

          <p className="text-background/55 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            Every Pure Metal VM includes fast NVMe-based storage suited for datasets,
            checkpoints, and scratch space, and is complemented by scalable storage designed
            for GPU-intensive AI workloads, accommodating data growth and high I/O demands.
